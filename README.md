Explaining the genetic causality for complex diseases by deep association kernel learning


Causal loci contribute to complex diseases in various manners. The comprehensive identification of suspicious genes requires a general genome-wide association study (GWAS) model that can work with different types of genetic effects. Here, we introduce a deep association kernel learning (DAK) model to enable automatic causal genotype encoding for pathway-level GWAS. Therefore, DAK is able to detect common and rare variants with complicated genetic effects that existing approaches fail.
